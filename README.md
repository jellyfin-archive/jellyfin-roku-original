### Getting Started Developing Jellyfin-Roku

First enable developer mode on your Roku device:

Then, zip up the source code directory. Visit YOUR-ROKU-IP in your browser, updating the IP address with the IP of the Roku device. From here you can upload the zip to the device. To debug, use any telnet client on port 8085 of the Roku. In windows, open a command promt:

telnet YOUR-ROKU-IP 8085
